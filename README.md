Users have a set standard what they expect to find when they arrive to a website e.g. navigation, contact page with contact details and so on.   
These needs and requirements were met throughout the website design. 

### **Design Choices:**
Design choices were made to have high usability of website.  
Classes were structured in table form as usually expected for such information. 
Membership choices were categorized to address all age groups.

### **Fonts:**
My font family choice is “Montserrat” with Sans Serif as a fall back what was taken from [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon&preview.text_type=custom).

### **Structure:**
The website consists of 5 separated pages namely index.html, about.html, membership.html, classes.html and contact.html.


### **Wireframes:**
 Wireframing helped me to put together the project without coding a single line.   
 Once the finished wireframes were printed the coding process was very smooth and straightforward.   
 Wireframes are available in [bmpr](/assets/wireframes/MS1-GYM.bmpr) and [pdf](/assets/wireframes/MS1-GYM.pdf) format.

### **Technologies used:**
The following languages and framework were used to create this project.  
* HTML5 – provided the main structure of the website.
* CSS3 – provided the styling of the website and the overall content.
* Bootstrap 4.6.1 – provided the responsive structure and some other component such as jumbotron, modal, navbar. 
* Balsamiq - development tool was used to create the wireframe for the website. 
* Git - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
* GitHub - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.


### **Testing:**
The main testing took place in Google Chrome and its Developer tool using the Network and Lighhouse options to  
identify any errors or opportunities to improve performance.    
After the deployment the website was tested on different screen sizes and in different OS systems.
I have asked my wife and few of my friends to test the website and their feedback was taken on board.  

### **Validation:**  
Html code was validated by [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)  

![result](/assets/images/HTMLvalidation.png)

Css code was validate by [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)  
![result](/assets/images/CSSvalidation.png)

The website accessibility was checked with [Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/).  
As a result I had to changed the font and background colors to achieve higher contrast to eliminate contast errors. 
The original orange color (#357464) was changed to (#c85410), grey color (#7d7d7d) was changed to (#757575) and 
the font color (#fafafa) was changed to (#fff) for better contrast ratio.

Conclusion: In the future the colors will be checked before the coding would even start. 

### **Deployment:**
**GitHub Pages**  
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository  
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.  
3. Alternatively Click Here for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
4. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
5. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

**Browser preview**
Browser preview was used between commits using the following steps...

1. Open terminal in GitPod 
2. With Ctrl+C the cursor was prompt
3. python3 -m http.server command line was used to open up a private port
4. Once the port was activated the page was opened by clicking on the Open Browser tab

### **Bugs:**
The menu toggler was one area where I spent lot of time to try to find a solution.     
My primary goal was to give a custom color scheme to the menu items and to the toggler too.   
After my second session with Mo (mentor). I decided to do this icon from scratch rather using the Bootstrap predefined icon.  
With that being done I was able to fully customize all the elements I wanted. 

Embedding images in div container and make them responsive was very time consuming in the beginning  of the task.  
I researched the topic and read many topics and watched a few Youtube tutorials and I was able to resolve the issue fully.

I received inspiration for this project from my mentor Mo who didn't let me to go   
the easy way and as a result I feel lot more confident to solve problems.
