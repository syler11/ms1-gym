Also this surface is retaining existing client providing information and facilities to them. 

### **User Requirements and Expectations:**
Users have a set standard what they expect to find when they arrive to a website e.g. navigation, contact page with contact details and so on.   
These needs and requirements were met throughout the website design. 

### **Design Choices:**
Design choices were made to have high usability of website.  
E.g. Classes were structured in table form as usually expected for such information. 
Membership choices were categorized to address all age groups.

### **Colors:**
Two main colors were used throughout the page namely 
* #e35b17 RGB(227, 91, 23)
* ##7d7d7d RGB(125, 125, 125)

### **Fonts:**
My font family choice is “Montserrat” with Sans Serif as a fall back what was taken from [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon&preview.text_type=custom)

### **Structure:**
The website consists of 5 separated pages namely index.html, about.html, membership.html, classes.html and contact.html.


### **Wireframes:**
 Wireframing helped me to put together the project without coding a single line.   
 Once the finished wireframes were printed the coding process was very smooth and straightforward. 
 Wireframes are saved in the assets/wireframes folder in bmpr and pdf format. 

### **Features:**
